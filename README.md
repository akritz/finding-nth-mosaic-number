# finding-nth-mosaic-number
Given an integer N, the task is to find the Nth Mosaic number. A Mosaic number can be expressed as follows:
If N = Aa * Bb * Cc … where A, B, C.. are the prime factors of N then the Nth Mosaic number will be A * a * B * b * C * c ….

Examples:

Input: N = 8
Output: 6
8 can be expressed as 23.
So, the 8th Mosaic number will be 2 * 3 = 6



Input: N = 36
Output: 24
36 can be expressed as 22 * 32.
2 * 2 * 3 * 2 = 24
